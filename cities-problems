What are the questions that we could answer with the "cities" data set?
  - We could compare rates of certain crimes across years in both Iowa and individual cities.
  - How does population change the type of crime a city experiences? If at all?
  - Was there been an overall increase or decrease of crime rates in from 2006-2015? Was it common across cities? Or driven primarily by one city?
  - What's the most dangerous city in Iowa? Or the safest?
